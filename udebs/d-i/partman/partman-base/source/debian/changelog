    "You need to clear out the sig_action structure, otherwise
     you leave crap in sa->sa_flags, in particular what can happen
     is that SA_ONSTACK gets set which is what causes the program
     to crash since the default signal stack value is zero."

      afterwards. Do not disable swap during init (but don't enable it either,
      as the status of existing swap partitions is unknown at that point).
      This, in combination with changes to the other partman components to
      not disable swap after formatting partitions, mean that swap is enabled
      as soon as possible after writing the partition table, and never turned
      off, unless the partition table must be changed. Closes: #260512

    - definitions.sh (partition_tree_choices): shorten the indent of the
      partitions; visual.d/name: change the width of the name from 14->12.
      These changes are because dvh disk labels have both primary/logical

    - creation of new label should ignore the non-zero codes returned by
      storage_device/label/do_option. 
    - visual.d/filesystem: show the unusable free spaces as "unusable"
      instead of "FREE SPACE".  Most of the partition table types do not
      have extended and logical partitions and there was no indication in
      the main menu when some free space is unusable.
    - move the confirmation dialog for the creation of new label from here
      to partman-partitioning.
    - for s390, make partman not to be default partitioner, as it does not
      handle ibm disk labels.
    - for m68k, do the same since partman is quiet slow here and doesn't
      support the atari subarch.
    - new binary stralign to work around the broken support of wide
      characters in printf.
    - visual.d/{filesystem,type,number} use stralign.
    - partman, visual.d/number: measure the width of partman/text/number
      using stralign

  * Anton Zinoviev
    - I observed that the type of the partition is not translatable.  So I
      added four new templates - "primary", "logical", "pri/log" and
      "unusable".  Sorry, translators - without the new templates
      these strings would be left untranslated anyway.
    - a necessary change for SPARCs.  Because of bug/limitation in the
      implementation of the Sun disk labels in libparted they must be
      written to the disk before any consequent edition.  Because of that
      a new template had to be added (it is going to be used only on SPARCs). 
    - these changes are still not used by the other code of partman.
  * Joey Hess
    - Parameterise the menu-item-number.
    - For arm, make partman not be the default partitioner, as it does not
      handle 4 partitioning schemes used by arm subarches.
    - For mips, do the same, since parted does not know about dvh
      partitioning. Also because it's kinda slow (15 minutes on a fast indy).
    - Minor polishing of the new template.

partman (3) never-released; urgency=low

  * parted_server: new functions start_timer, stop_timer, timer_handler,
    timered_file_system_create, timered_file_system_check,
    timered_file_system_copy and timered_file_system_resize.  Used
    timered_...(...) instead of ped_...(..., NULL).
  * definitions: support for timers in exception_handler.  New function
    name_progress_bar
  * New scripts: backup in init.d, unbackup in undo.d, remove_backup in
    commit.d.
  * update.d/detected_filesystem exits if there is a file
    /var/lib/partman/filesystems_detected.  New scripts:
    init.d/filesystems_detected and commit.d/filesystems_changed.
  * Uses `exit 0' and `return 0' instead of just `exit' and `return'.

partman (2) never-released; urgency=low

  * Merged with partman-parted.
  * Uses init.d, undo.d and commit.d.
  * The device directory is /var/lib/partman/devices rather than somewhere
    in /tmp.
  * Each device has it own partition directory which contains only
    information from name.d.
  * parted_devices is in /bin.  Returns bytes rather than human size.
    server is renamed to parted_server and is also in /bin.
  * Renamings of the files in the device-directories: parted_name->device,
    device_name->model, size contains blocks rather than human size.  name
    is removed.
  * The creation of new label is moved in partman-partitioning.
