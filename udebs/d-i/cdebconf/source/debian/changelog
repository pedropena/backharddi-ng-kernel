  * Load frontend with RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL to allow plugins to access
    frontend API without requiring calls to dlsym().  Kudos to Steve Langasek
    for the help to figure this out!
  * Put frontend plugins symbol in the "cdebconf_" namespaces.  The old
    symbols are still looked up as a fallback to ensure compatibility.
  * Fix a memory leak in plugin_new() along the way.
  * Switch the newt frontend to use "cdebconf_newt_" namespace for its API.
  * Rename config-newt.h to cdebconf_newt.h for consistency.  This header
    defines the public interface used by plugins for the newt frontend.
  * Merge changes to the GTK+ frontend from the "fe_gtk" branch:
    - Rewritten codebase, more readable and documented.
    - Switch "Screenshot" button as secondary.
    - Define a clear API for plugins.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * debian/rules: add -l option in the dh_shlibsdep call for the gtk udeb to
    ensure it gets a correct dependency on licairo-directfb2-udeb.
    This means we need an additional build dependency on libcairo-directfb2,
    but no longer need the versioned dependency on dpkg-dev. The same solution
    was chosen for cairo itself and is probably more reliable than depending
    on RPATH in objdump (especially as lintian does not seem to like RPATHs).

  [ Attilio Fiandrotti ]
  * Removed workaround for #407035 because upstream fixed in gtk+ 2.10.x series.

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * debian/rules: remove the -l option in the dh_shlibsdep call.
    As it effectively was a no-op before the previous release, it looks like
    it is no longer needed.
  * Add versioned dependency on dpkg-dev (>=1.14.5) because earlier versions
    have a bug in the parsing of rdepends from objdump which makes the gtk
    udeb depend on the wrong library for cairo (cf. #427988).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Set debconf/translations-dropped to true if translations are permanently
    dropped. (The implementation isn't in exactly the right place; see the
    comment in src/confmodule.c.)
  * It's the 21st century. Move configure.in to configure.ac so that we use
    autoconf >= 2.50.
  * Fix broken --without-rpath configure option.
  * Clean up configure.ac quoting and message emission.
  * Use printf rather than echo to send commands to cdebconf, to avoid
    breaking escaped commands if /bin/sh is dash (cf. #306134).
  * Avoid using non-XSI local variables; instead use a nasty temporary IFS
    setting hack and _db_local_ namespace (cf. #242011).
  * Don't define db_stop twice in shell confmodule.

  [ Attilio Fiandrotti ]

  * Removed workaround for #404482, fixed upstream in gtk+ release 2.10.13.

  [ Otavio Salvador ]
  * Reduce the usage of casting to struct frontend_data on GTK frontend
    code. Closes: #426745.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove five function pointers in every struct template that always
    pointed to the same functions (or were entirely unused, in the cases of
    get and set); export those functions from template.c instead.
  * Fix off-by-one error reading from confmodule (thanks, Baruch Even;
    closes: #430108).
  * Document proposed PROGRESS REGION command.
  * Fix a bunch of reference-counting bugs and other memory leaks.
  * If DEBCONF_DROP_TRANSLATIONS is set to 1, then don't read translations
    we aren't going to use, and reload the templates database if the
    language is changed since we might not have the correct translations in
    memory any more. This saves around 20MB of memory at d-i run-time
    (closes: #329743). Note that this means that after the templates
    database is first saved (in practice, after anna has run), it will no
    longer be possible to change the language and get translated messages.

    progresscancel state changes (closes: https://launchpad.net/bugs/47733).
  * Allow Choices-C to be listed separately from Choices (etc.) in templates

  * Workaround for a GTKDFB bug that causes first pixels of sentences
    to be sometimes cutted away, thanks to Davide Viti and Mohammed
    Adnène Trojette for finding this bug.
  * Added support for PROGRESSCANCEL command to the GTK frontend, whose
    GTK signals handling system is now asynchronous (closes: #322381).
  * Buttons in the GTK frontend are now translated also if progressbar
    is started before a question is asked (closes: #355804).

  * Add shlibs line for libdebconfclient0-udeb.

  * Reset question template pointers whenever they change, not just when the
    tag changes; do this in X_LOADTEMPLATEFILE and dpkg-reconfigure as well
    as debconf-loadtemplate.
  * Add a remove method to the question database; use this to migrate

  * Fix early return from text_progress_set, broken by progress bar
    cancellation.
  * Add 'cdebconf' extension to man pages to avoid clashing with
    debconf-doc.
  * Actually set TARGET during install target, as apparently expected by
    src/Makefile.in, so that we don't try to install includes into udebs
    (although luckily we failed to do so due to dh_install).
  * Move cdebconf binaries to /usr/lib/cdebconf, leaving symlinks in
    /usr/bin and /usr/sbin behind only in the udeb; drop
    /usr/share/debconf/confmodule and /usr/share/debconf/frontend from the
    deb. This renders cdebconf coinstallable with debconf, although changes
    to the debconf confmodule are required to make it actually useful.
  * Remove cdebconf preinst and postrm, no longer required.
  * Remove dpkg-reconfigure from the udeb; d-i apparently hasn't used it
    since main-menu 0.018. Saves about 4KB.

    - Stop hardcoding configdb and templatedb in stack database
      initialisation.
    - Use question_db_new instance parameter in debconf-copydb and

      variable.
    - Constify question_db_new instance parameter.
    - If DEBCONF_NO_I18N=1 is set in the environment, ignore localised
      fields in templates. This is a hack to let debconf-copydb and
      debconf-dumpdb work with template databases produced by debconf.
    - Look at config::instance::*::template to find out which template
      database to use when reading a given config database (which makes a
      difference for questions created using REGISTER). This is only used by
      debconf-copydb and debconf-dumpdb right now, and the global template
      database is retained as a fallback.
    - Add template instance for the debconf database in /target to the
      distributed cdebconf.conf, and associate it with target_configdb.
    - Remove assumption that RFC822 lines are no more than 8192 bytes long:
      the config entry for console-data/keymap/full violates that. In the
      process, consolidate the multiple duplicate definitions of
      unescapestr() and escapestr() into one place.

  NOTE: Not for sarge.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add draft plugins specification.
    - Append '\n' to debug messages automatically when printing to stderr,
      so that they aren't needed in every string.
    - Tidy up libdebconfclient namespace: rename debconf_commandf to
      debconfclient_commandf and make it static. Doesn't seem to affect any
      current users, and if it does, they should have been using
      debconf->commandf() instead.
    - Sync from debconf (closes: #266898):
      + Change the shell confmodule to not construct functions on the fly.
        The new code is smaller, a bit faster, and simpler, but the
        important thing is that it does not clobber $@. The old version
        messed up $@ if parameters contained spaces.
    - Add config instances for the standard debconf databases in /target, so
      that we can do 'debconf-copydb -p foo/bar configdb target_configdb'
      once the base system is installed.
    - Remove src/cdebconf.conf-dist on distclean.
    - Fix some of the build issues with the corba frontend, although it
      still doesn't even remotely build or work.
    - Fix compiler warning in slang frontend.
    - Allocate choices, choices_translated, defaults, and selected
      dynamically in slang frontend, fixing a crash bug.
    - Set up slang select/multiselect windows so that the first selected
      option is always visible (closes: #183541).
    - Improve how titles are displayed in the text frontend: set titles off
      with an underline, and only display a title if it's different from the
      previous one (closes: #281395).
  * Matthias Urlichs:
    - Clarify ANS: lines in test.config output.
    - Set _cmdline::frontend rather than frontend::default::driver in
      response to 'debconf -f <frontend>', fixing that.

cdebconf (0.75) experimental; urgency=low

  NOTE: Not for sarge.
  * Colin Watson
    - Add an INFO command, which may (depending on the frontend) display an
      out-of-band informative message. Unlike inputting a note, this doesn't
      require an acknowledgement from the user. Like PROGRESS INFO,
      frontends should display the info persistently until some other info
      comes along. In the newt frontend, this appears as text at the top
      left-hand corner of the screen; no other frontends implement it yet.
    - Fix text frontend segfault when encountering empty elements in Choices
      field (closes: #256557).
    - Fix memory leaks in METAGET, PROGRESS, and SETTITLE commands.
    - Make the text frontend output a blank line before the first title in
      go() if it was already displaying a progress bar (closes: #271707).
    - If possible, clean source directory in 'debian/rules clean' so that
      test builds don't make it into source packages.
    - cdebconf-udeb provides debconf-2.0.
    - Enable stack driver.
    - Move answers to password questions out of
      /var/lib/cdebconf/questions.dat to /var/lib/cdebconf/passwords.dat.
    - Some const-correctness improvements.
    - Add iterate methods to rfc822db, making debconf-copydb and
      debconf-dumpdb work (closes: #213266). This uses a horrible
      non-thread-safe technique involving building a temporary list with a
      pointer to each node in order, which will of course use a fair amount
      of memory, because the twalk() interface doesn't allow for anything
      better. If we ever switch to a completely different cache mechanism,
      this can go away.
    - Fix option parsing in debconf-copydb, debconf-dumpdb, and
      dpkg-reconfigure.
    - Implement -p/--pattern option in debconf-copydb and debconf-dumpdb.
      Note that, unlike Perl debconf, this takes an extended regular
      expression rather than a Perl regular expression, but it should be
      close enough for most uses.
    - Make --without-syslog-logging (a) work and (b) be the default. (The
      udeb build still uses syslog logging.)
  * Joey Hess
    - Apply patch from Denis to fix rfc822db to not output empty Value fields
      if the value is not set. Closes: #257180
    - Patch from mdz to support the DATA command, as used by the (perl)
      debconf passthrough frontend (as patched by mdz to work as of debconf
      1.4.42). This allows dpkg-reconfigure inside the chroot to communicate
      with the user using the existing cdebconf d-i frontend.
  * Matthias Urlichs
    - Check for newtInit() in configure, and build the newt frontend if
      found.

  * Colin Watson
    - Fix a couple of compiler warnings in the stack driver.
    - Set config_passwd_db path in example cdebconf.conf to passwords.dat
      rather than templates.dat.
    - Attempt to read cdebconf.conf configuration tags with quote-removal
      (strparsecword) and only try without quote-removal (strparsequoteword)
      if that fails. The strange function naming wasn't my idea ... Fixes
      incorrect parsing of stack driver parts of example cdebconf.conf.
    - Initialise next pointers in template/question stacks properly.
    - Implement accept_types and reject_types in stack driver.

    - gtk frontend work:
      + Set window title on GO.
      + Make cdebconf-gtk-udeb packaging work (still not built by default).
      + Make the Forward button the default widget, so that pressing Enter
        activates it.
    - Make the value of DEBCONF_OLD_FD_BASE available via the shell
      confmodule.

  * Colin Watson
    - gtk frontend work (not built for sarge, so no risk):
      + Allocate choices, choices_translated, and defvals dynamically. Fixes
        several crash bugs.
      + Fix a type mismatch that generated a compiler warning.
      + Disable help popup on multiselects, since it made it impossible to
        actually select anything. Ditto on password keyboard focus grab.
      + Implement the text type, just as an alias of note for now.
      + Drop the old back/continue buttons entirely, as they only appear
        sometimes and having both them and the druid-style buttons is very
        confusing. Fix sensitivity of druid-style buttons.

    - Major improvements to the text frontend:
      + '\r' is not supported by all terminals, which made progress bars
        unreadable.  The display is now:
          Progress bar title ..20%..40%..60%..80%..100%
        Closes: #195704
      + Add support for backing up.  Closes: #183107
      + For most questions, prints the short description below the extended
        one.
      + String and passwd questions accept an empty answer.
      + A contextual help message is available at prompt.
      + Progress bar refresh is set to a minimum of 10% to prevent
        too verbose output.
      + Select and multiselect questions look now more like debconf
        readline questions.
      + Define a ISEMPTY macro to deal with empty strings on s390.
    - The previous fix about the seen flag broke when a package is
      left half-configured.  To prevent this problem, the seen
      flag is never written to the questions.dat file (for cdebconf-udeb
      only) as suggested by Joey Hess.  Closes: #229648
    - Add a --enable-d-i flag to the configure script, invoked when
      building cdebconf-udeb.  This option add -DDI_UDEB to CFLAGS.

      the "Create %s file system" problem in partconf. (Closes: #224493)
  * Denis Barbier
    - Steal code from debconf to go back over skipped questions.
      Closes: #225861, #229719
    - As locales are not installed during early stage of installation,
      sorting cannot be performed at run-time, and templates must
      contain sorting order.  Thus the Listorder fields is removed and
      replaced by a new Indices field.  If a template contains
        Choices: a, b, c
        Choices-ll.UTF-8: x, y, z
        Indices-ll.UTF-8: 3, 1, 2
      this means that 'a' is translated into 'x', 'b' into 'y' and 'c'
      into 'z' for the language 'll', but "z, x, y" is displayed in that
      order.
    - If frontend is set to 'none', a dummy frontend is initialized.
      This can be useful in conjunction with debconf-communicate, e.g.
      to fix #223344.
    - Only newt and text frontends are currently supported.  Do not
      build other packages (neither debs nor udebs), and strip build
      dependencies.
      The dependency problem caused by cdebconf-gtk-udeb goes away,
      and a solution is worked on in case this frontend is back later
      (which is the reason why these entries are not removed from
      debian/control), so there is no need to keep this bugreport open.
      Closes: #218472

    - Sort translated choices when a select/multiselect template contains
      a line Listorder: lexicographic
      If some Choices items must not be sorted, they can be prepended with

    - finish support for backing up; names of seen questions are
      stored in a new member of confmodule, these questions are
      only marked as seen when session is over.
    - when SIGUSR1 is received, reads debian-installer/language value
      and sets LANGUAGE environment variable accordingly.
    - change progress bars interface: displayed strings are extracted
      from a template in order to help their l10n.
    - with text frontend, do not display title when question is
      skipped.  (closes: #177720)
  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Move rfc822 functions into libcdebconf from rfc822db module
    - Fix getwidth to work properly on serial consoles.  Hopefully.
  * Martin Sjögren:
    - Make the slang frontend slightly friendlier to programs that produce
      output themselves.
  * Petter Reinholdtsen
    - Add configure option --with-default-frontend to make it easier to
      change frontend at compile time.
    - In cdebconf-udeb, do not change the debconf priority setting if
      environment DEBCONF_PRIORITY is set.
    - The slang frontend is no longer part of cdebconf-udeb, but is
      a separate package (Closes: #84230).
  * Matt Kraai
    - Add a cdebconf-slang-udeb package.
    - NULL-terminate strvacat argument lists (Closes: #178402).

cdebconf (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * Denis Barbier:
    - improve slang frontend, in order to make it more dialog-like.
      When it is not ambiguous, pressing Enter key validate current
      input and go to the next step.  Rename <Previous>/<Next> into
      <Next>/<Cancel>.
    - add support for backing up; it is only activated when script
      invoke the "backup" debconf command.
  * Tollef Fog Heen
    - remove textdb from udeb build

cdebconf (0.28) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bastian Blank:
    - split cleanup() into save() and cleanup().
    - add a sighandler for SIGUSR1 which only saves the data.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - when a select has a single choice, let it be the default.
    - cdebconf did gobble everything in extended descriptions
      after a paragraph or a line beginning with a leading space.

cdebconf (0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bastian Blank:
    - fix multiselect question within the text frontend.
    - add sighandler for SIGTERM
    - add exit(1) to the end of the sighandler.
    - modify the macros STRDUP and FREE to handle null pointers correctly.
    - use question_getvalue(...) not q->value.
    - check for value == NULL within command_get and command_metaget.
    - use default language for metaget.
    - add STRDUP_NOTNULL with the old behaviour of STRDUP. the client 
      doesn't expect a value of NULL.
    - add myself to Uploaders.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Clean up function interface with l10n'ed fields: 'get' and 'set'
      functions in the template structure are no more used.
    - The getlanguage function is moved to template.c so that i18n is
      fully handled by template.c
    - Remove a superfluous trailing space in extended descriptions
    - Use LANGUAGE environment variable instead of DEBCONF_LANG.
      This variable is a colon separated list of languages.
    - Fix the textdb driver wrt localized fields
    - Support localized Default fields
    - There are now 2 ways to retrieve question values, question_getvalue(q,l)
      return either NULL or question value if it exists, and
      question_get_field(q,l,"value") always return a valid string.  With the
      latter, variable substitutions are also performed.
    - Add support for the DEBCONF_SHOWOLD environment variable.  Its default
      is currently "true".
    - Improve support of the 'seen' flag; dixit joeyh, flags should be
      set when closing session to help backing up, but it needs some
      extra work.

  * Tollef Fog Heen:
    - Add stack module.
    - Add possibility to specify modname when doing template_db_new and
      question_db_new, this breaks compatibility, so bump soname as well.
      Integer sonames are good for your health and stomach, so make
      libdebconf.so.1 the soname
    - have make clean remove the static library as well.
    - make -o in debconf work.
    - fix harmless compile warning in rfc822db.c's get method.
  * Denis Barbier:
    - Fix select/multiselect with slang frontend
    - remove defaultval member in question structure
    - partially handle localized fields, only UTF-8 templates files
      are considered
    - change internal template structure in src/template.h in order
      to help managing localized fields, and fix doc/modules.txt
      accordingly
    - define accessors to get and set template values, should be used
      everywhere instead of direct access to structure members
    - modify question API when dealing with templates values
    - fix frontends and db to work with these changes

      know about multiple provides, yet.
    - don't try to be smart in the text frontend about finding templates
      for broken questions, since it breaks if the question is
      registered.

      a dot to end.
    - fix confmodule.c and commands.c to not use fixed-size
