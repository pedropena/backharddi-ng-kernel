__Choices: Retry network autoconfiguration, Retry network autoconfiguration with a DHCP hostname, Configure network manually, ${wifireconf}, Do not configure the network at this time
Default: Configure network manually
_Description: Network configuration method:
 From here you can choose to retry DHCP network autoconfiguration
 (which may succeed if your DHCP server takes a long time to respond)
 or to configure the network manually. Some DHCP servers require
 a DHCP hostname to be sent by the client, so you can also choose
 to retry DHCP network autoconfiguration with a hostname that you
 provide.

Template: netcfg/dhcp_failed
Type: note
_Description: Network autoconfiguration failed
 Your network is probably not using the DHCP protocol. Alternatively, the
 DHCP server may be slow or some network hardware is not working properly.

Template: netcfg/no_default_route
Type: boolean
_Description: Continue without a default route?
 The network autoconfiguration was successful. However, no default route
 was set: the system does not know how to communicate with hosts on the
 Internet. This will make it impossible to continue with the installation
 unless you have the first installation CD-ROM, a 'Netinst' CD-ROM, or
 packages available on the local network.
 .
 If you are unsure, you should not continue without a default route:
 contact your local network administrator about this problem.
