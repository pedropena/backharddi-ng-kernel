mkntfs now creates NTFS 3.1 (Windows XP) volumes by default.  The old NTFS 1.2
format is now deprecated and whilst it can still be specified using a command
line option, it will be removed in a future release.

ntfsmount can create/delete/move files and directories!  It is not a full
implementation, thus sometimes it will say 'Operation is not supported',
nothing bad will happen to user data in this case.  (Yura Pakhuchiy)

Add new utility: ntfsmount.  It is a FUSE module that uses on libntfs.  So,
you need FUSE 2.3 to compile it.  This module supports file overwrite including
changing the file size and can read/write/add/remove named data streams via
"file:stream" interface and list them via "ntfs.streams.list" extended
attribute (this only if xattr support is enabled).  (Yura Pakhuchiy)

Moved back from BitKeeper to CVS on SF.net.
