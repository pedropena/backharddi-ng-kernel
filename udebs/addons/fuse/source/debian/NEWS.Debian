fuse (2.6.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The fuse-source package is back. Even though fuse comes with all recent
  2.6 kernels, some software (i.e. ntfs-3g) needs the most recent fuse API
  to enable all its features.

fuse (2.5.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Since this version there won't be separate fuse-source package.
  This module is available in all recent kernels and these kernels are
  going to be default for Etch.

fuse (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  fuse-utils doesn't use debconf questions to handle creation of group
  able to use setuid fusermount anymore. Due to some bugs (#307627, #342826,
  #310964, #306281, #307624) it's not possible to safety remove previously
  created groups and ensure that everything is going to work after that.

  Thus I simply dropped debconf related part of packaging scripts. It's
  up to you to clean left mess.

  These files were used previously to handle creation of group and may be
  interesting for you:

  /etc/group

  If you used default values then you can simply remove /etc/default/fuse
  file and everything should work fine.

  Sorry for inconvieniences.
