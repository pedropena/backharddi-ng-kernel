.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B uuidd
daemon is used by the UUID library to generate
universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), especially time-based UUID's
in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of large
numbers of threads trying to grab UUID's running on different CPU's.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Run
.B uuidd
in debugging mode.  This prevents uuidd from running as a daemon.
.TP
.B \-k
If a currently uuidd daemon is running, kill it.
.TP
.BI \-n " number"
When issuing a test request to a running uuidd, request a bulk response
of
.I number
UUID's.
.TP
.BI \-p  " pidfile"
Specify the pathname where the pid file should be written.  By default,
the pid file is written to /var/run/uuidd/uuidd.pid.
.TP
.BI \-s " socketpath"
Specify the pathname used for the unix-domain socket used by uuidd.  By
default, the pathname used is /var/run/uuidd/request.  This is primarily
for debugging purposes, since the pathname is hard-coded in the libuuid
library.
.TP
.B \-r
Test uuidd by trying to connect to a running uuidd daemon and
request it to return a random-based UUID.
.TP
.B \-t
Test uuidd by trying to connect to a running uuidd daemon and
request it to return a time-based UUID.
.TP
.BI \-T " timeout"
Specify a timeout for uuidd.  If specified, then uuidd will exit after
.I timeout
seconds of inactivity.
.SH AUTHOR
The
.B uuidd
daemon  was written by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>.
.SH AVAILABILITY
uuidd is part of the util-linux-ng package and is available from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux-ng/.
