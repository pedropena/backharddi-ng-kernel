.\" Details:
.\" arch prints the machine part of the system_utsname struct
.\" This struct is defined in version.c, and this field is
.\" initialized with UTS_MACHINE, which is defined as $ARCH
.\" in the main Makefile.
.\" That gives the possibilities 
.\" alpha    arm      i386     m68k     mips     ppc      sparc    sparc64
.\"
.\" If Makefile is not edited, ARCH is guessed by
.\" ARCH := $(shell uname -m | sed -e s/i.86/i386/ -e s/sun4u/sparc64/)
.\" Then how come we get these i586 values?
.\" Well, the routine check_bugs() does system_utsname.machine[1] = '0' + x86;
.\" (called in init/main.c, defined in ./include/asm-i386/bugs.h)
