.TH TAILF 1 "13 February 2003" "" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
tailf \- follow the growth of a log file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI tailf " file"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tailf
will print out the last 10 lines of a file and then wait for the file to
grow.  It is similar to
.B tail -f
but does not access the file when it is not growing.  This has the side
effect of not updating the access time for the file, so a filesystem flush
does not occur periodically when no log activity is happening.
.PP
.B tailf
is extremely useful for monitoring log files on a laptop when logging is
infrequent and the user desires that the hard disk spin down to conserve
battery life.
.SH BUGS
An option could be provided to print out the last
.I n
lines instead of the last 10.
