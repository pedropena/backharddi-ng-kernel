Hello Andries,

Here is a patch for adding multi-byte locale support to a few programs
found in util-linux-2.9u. With these patches, the programs

    col colcrt colrm column rev ul

now work correctly in UTF-8 locales. This is done by using the ISO C / SUSV2
i18n functions, therefore they will become effective when glibc-2.2 comes
out. For the moment, you can test the patches by
  1. defining ENABLE_WIDECHAR in defines.h
  2. Change the #if 0 to #if 1 in lib/widechar.h
  3. Modify your CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to include the directories where libutf8
     is installed.
