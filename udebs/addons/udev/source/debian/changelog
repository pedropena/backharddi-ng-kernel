udev (0.105-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, contains only bug fixes. Fixes:
    + typos. (Closes: #408752)
    + intermittent troubles when renaming interfaces. (Closes: #405775)
  * Removed the following patches which were merged upstream:
    fix_serial_short raid_endianess_fix m32r_syscalls selinux_fix.
  * Backported the upstream changeset 5ab2e3c2c3efe9b25861ddf560b3760b9384090d
    which adds the LUN to iSCSI paths. (Closes: #409385)
  * Backed out the upstream changeset 273bebdba66cd5543dc1b076447e3275c81c221c
    which removed compatibility support for the DRIVER key.
  * Raised the dependency on module-init-tools to 3.2.2-1, which provides
    the --use-blacklist option.
  * hotplug.rules: call modprobe with the --use-blacklist option to allow

    device drivers. (Closes: #407256)

    symlinks. Already applied upstream. (Closes: #401695)

    on m32r systems. Already applied upstream. (Closes: #401826)
  * initramfs.premount premount: create the db directory before starting
    udevd, to catch some early kernel-generated events (this has no
    practical effect since the events will be immediately retriggered).
    Apply the same change to the init script. (Closes: #402320)
  * persistent-net-generator.rules: ignore ath* devices with type=802
    because they have the same MAC address of the "normal" interface and
    cause write_net_rules to write a new bogus rule every time.
    (Closes: #404983)
  * net.agent: improve robustness by checking sysfs instead of the ifstate
    file and removing the timeout. Patch and testing by Joey Hess.
    (Closes: #403804, #403805)

  * Implemented no_static_dev when a initramfs is used. (Closes: #397476)
  * Robustness: fixed postinst to not fail if /dev/{pts,shm}/ do not exist,
    which usually should not happen. (Closes: #395136)
  * Do not mention CONFIG_KOBJECT_UEVENT in README.Debian. (Closes: #399624)
  * Made the init script recognize /dev/null as a valid boot-time console,

udev (0.100-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * udev.{templates,preinst}, rules: use debconf for prompting the user

    + Fixes a typo. (Closes: #385867)
  * Fixed persistent-net-generator.rules which was broken in 0.098-2.
  * Use /lib/udev/devices/ instead of /etc/udev/ as the temporary mount
    point in the init script, because it's nicer and it helps SELinux users.
  * Converted the versioned dependency on initscripts in a conflict.
  * Create a temporary symlink for /dev in the initramfs. (Closes: #386294)

 -- Marco d'Itri <md@linux.it>  Wed,  6 Sep 2006 23:41:52 +0200

udev (0.098-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added patch close_pipes_on_exec to close the pipes file descriptors
    in udevd before running external programs, to prevent dealocks caused
    by programs waiting in the background for some condition when
    udev_log="debug". (Closes: #375598)
  * Updated net.agent to close stdout and stderr (see above) and
    automatically fork and continue in background.
  * Call cdrom_id on SCSI devices in permissions.rules instead of
    cd-aliases-generator.rules to prevent generating again the rules
    every time. (Closes: #374539)
  * NEWS.Debian: removed obsolete parts, added new entries.

udev (0.097-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Since support for %e has been removed, permanently retire
    cd-aliases.rules and if it is in use replace it in postinst with
    cd-aliases-generator.rules. (See #359978.)
  * Postinst will remove on upgrades the link to hotplugd.rules, if one
    exists. This disables default support for /etc/hotplug.d/ and /etc/dev.d/.
  * Raised Priority to important.
  * Removed "Provides: hotplug".
  * Added a script to copy the persistent names from d-i to the target.
  * Added to the init script support for the reload argument, which is
    almost never needed.
  * initramfs.bottom: use nuke instead of rm -rf. (Closes: #376349)

  * postinst: updated the path to initramfs.conf. (Closes: #375299)
  * Added a tentative fix for the "$TEMPDEV directory is not empty"
    issue on the first install.
  * The init script depends on mountkernfs, not on mountvirtfs.
    (Closes: #375389)
  * Add another USB product name to create /dev/pilot for programs too
    stupid to use HAL. (Closes: #378512)
  * Use ENV{PHYSDEVDRIVER} instead of DRIVER in
    persistent-net-generator.rules. (Closes: #376589)

  * Removed support for the undocumented udevd_timeout config file parameter.
  * Removed the deprecated /sbin/udevsend command.
  * Removed the /dev/.udevdb/ directory kept for compatibility with old

  * Stop enabling hotplugd.rules by default.
  * Removed the versioned dependency on sed, which has not been needed since
    many months ago.

  * write_cd_rules: create dvdrw links for DVD-R drives too. (Closes: #365224)
  * write_net_rules: add DRIVER=="?*" to all rules in the hope that this
    will make them not match bridges and VLAN sub-interfaces without
    breaking any other interface. More information from the kernel and from
    kernel developers would be welcome. (Closes: #365248)

udev (0.091-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    + Improved the error messages about incorrect rules.
  * Fixed a dashism in the write_*_rules scrips which broke detection of

udev (0.090-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * persistent-net-generator.rules: ignore VLAN subinterfaces, because
    they usually have the same MAC address of the main interface.
  * Added patch udev-compare-name-01 from the upstream maintainer.
    It adds support for matching on NAME and this allows not needing to
    set ENV{INTERFACE_OLD}, which can now be removed from the
    z25_persistent-net.rules file. Now any rule which sets the name of a
    network interface will prevent write_net_rules from running.
    This also means that rules must properly use = and == for assignments
    and comparisons.
  * Renamed the /lib/udev/write_*_aliases programs to write_*_rules.
  * Create z25_persistent-net.rules the first time udev is installed.
