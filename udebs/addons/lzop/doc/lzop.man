       lzop - compress or expand files

AABBSSTTRRAACCTT
       llzzoopp is a file compressor very similar to ggzziipp.  llzzoopp favors speed over
       compression ratio.

       _n_a_m_e ...]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       llzzoopp reduces the size of the named files. Whenever possible, each file
       is compressed into one with the extension ..llzzoo, while keeping the same
       ownership modes, access and modification times. If no files are speci-
       fied, or if a file name is "-", lzop tries to compress the standard
       input to the standard output. lzop will only attempt to compress regu-
       lar files or symbolic links to regular files.  In particular, it will
       ignore directories.

       If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, llzzoopp trun-
       cates it.

       Compressed files can be restored to their original form using llzzoopp --dd.
       llzzoopp --dd takes a list of files on its command line and decompresses each
       file whose name ends with ..llzzoo and which begins with the correct magic
       number to an uncompressed file without the original extension. llzzoopp --dd
       also recognizes the special extension ..ttzzoo as shorthand for ..ttaarr..llzzoo.
       When compressing, lzop uses the ..ttzzoo extension if necessary instead of
       truncating a file with a ..ttaarr extension.

       llzzoopp stores the original file name, mode and time stamp in the com-
       pressed file. These can be used when decompressing the file with the --dd
       option. This is useful when the compressed file name was truncated or
       when the time stamp was not preserved after a file transfer.

       llzzoopp preserves the ownership, mode and time stamp of files when com-
       pressing. When decompressing lzop restores the mode and time stamp if
       present in the compressed files.  See the options --nn, --NN, ----nnoo--mmooddee and
       ----nnoo--ttiimmee for more information.

       llzzoopp always keeps original files unchanged unless you use the option
       --UU.

       llzzoopp uses the _L_Z_O _d_a_t_a _c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n _l_i_b_r_a_r_y for compression services.
       The amount of compression obtained depends on the size of the input and
       the distribution of common substrings.  Typically, text such as source
       code or English is compressed into 40-50% of the original size, and
       large files usually compress much better than small ones. Compression
       and decompression speed is generally much faster than that achieved by
       ggzziipp, but compression ratio is worse.

       CCOOMMPPRREESSSSIIOONN LLEEVVEELLSS

       lzop offers the following compression levels of the LZO1X algorithm:

       -3  the default level offers pretty fast compression.  -2, -3, -4, -5
           and -6 are currently all equivalent - this may change in a future
           release.

       -1, --fast
           can be even a little bit faster in some cases - but most times you
           won't notice the difference

       -7, -8, -9, --best
           these compression levels are mainly intended for generating pre-
           compressed data - especially --99 can be somewhat slow

       Decompression is _v_e_r_y fast for all compression levels, and decompres-
       sion speed is not affected by the compression level.

MMAAIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDD
       If no other command is given then lzop defaults to compression (using
       compression level -3).

       -#, --fast, --best
           Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit ##,
           where -1 or --fast indicates the fastest compression method (less
           compression) and -9 or --best indicates the slowest compression
           method (best compression). The default compression level is -3.

       -d, --decompress, --uncompress
           Decompress. Each file will be placed into same the directory as the
           compressed file.

       -x, --extract
           Extract compressed files to the current working directory. This is
           the same as `-dNp'.

       -t, --test
           Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

       -l, --list
           For each compressed file, list the following fields:

             method: compression method
             compressed: size of the compressed file
             uncompr.: size of the uncompressed file
             ratio: compression ratio
             uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

           In combination with the --verbose option, the following fields are
           also displayed:

             date & time: time stamp for the uncompressed file

           With --name, the uncompressed name, date and time are those stored
           within the compress file if present.

           With --verbose, the size totals and compression ratio for all files
           is also displayed. With --quiet, the title and totals lines are not
           displayed.

           Note that lzop defines compression ratio as compressed_size /
           uncompressed_size.

       --ls, --ls=_F_L_A_G_S
           List each compressed file in a format similar to llss --llnn.

           The following flags are currently honoured:
             F  Append a `*' for executable files.
             G  Inhibit display of group information.
             Q  Enclose file names in double quotes.

       --info
           For each compressed file, list the internal header fields.

       -I, --sysinfo
           Display information about the system and quit.

       -L, --license
           Display the lzop license and quit.

       -h, -H, --help
           Display a help screen and quit.

       -V  Version. Display the version number and compilation options and
           quit.

       --version
           Version. Display the version number and quit.

       Commands are listed in increasing priority here, i.e.  --tt has priority
       over --dd, --ll over --tt, and so on.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       -c, --stdout, --to-stdout
           Write output on standard output. If there are several input files,
           the output consists of a sequence of independently (de)compressed
           members. To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files
           before compressing them.

       -o _F_I_L_E, --output=_F_I_L_E
           Write output to the file _F_I_L_E. If there are several input files,
           the output consists of a sequence of independently (de)compressed
           members.

       -p, -p_D_I_R, --path=_D_I_R
           Write output files into the directory _D_I_R instead of the directory
           determined by the input file. If _D_I_R is omitted, then write to the
           current working directory.

       -f, --force
           Force lzop to

            - overwrite existing files
            - (de-)compress from stdin even if it seems a terminal
            - (de-)compress to stdout even if it seems a terminal
            - allow option -c in combination with -U

           Using --ff two or more times forces things like

            - compress files that already have a .lzo suffix
            - try to decompress files that do not have a valid suffix
            - try to handle compressed files with unknown header flags

           Use with care.

       -F, --no-checksum
           Do not store or verify a checksum of the uncompressed file when
           compressing or decompressing.  This speeds up the operation of lzop
           a little bit (especially when decompressing), but as unnoticed data
           corruption can happen in case of damaged compressed files the usage
           of this option is not generally recommended.  Also, a checksum is
           always stored when compressing with one of the slow compression
           levels (-7, -8 or -9), regardless of this option.

       -n, --no-name
           When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if
           present (remove only the lzop suffix from the compressed file
           name). This option is the default under UNIX.

       -N, --name
           When decompressing, restore the original file name if present. This
           option is useful on systems which have a limit on file name length.
           If the original name saved in the compressed file is not suitable
           for its file system, a new name is constructed from the original
           one to make it legal.  This option is the default under DOS, Win-
           dows and OS/2.

       -P  When decompressing, restore the original path and file name if
           present.  When compressing, store the relative (and cleaned) path
           name.  This option is mainly useful when using aarrcchhiivvee mmooddee - see
           usage examples below.

       --no-mode
           When decompressing, do not restore the original mode (permissions)
           saved in the compressed file.

       --no-time
           When decompressing, do not restore the original time stamp saved in
           the compressed file.

       -S _._s_u_f, --suffix=_._s_u_f
           Use suffix _._s_u_f instead of _._l_z_o. The suffix must not contain multi-
           ple dots and special characters like '+' or '*', and suffixes other
           than _._l_z_o should be avoided to avoid confusion when files are
           transferred to other systems.

       -k, --keep
           Do not delete input files. This is the default.

       -U, --unlink, --delete
           Delete input files after succesfull compression or decompression.
           Use this option to make lzop behave like ggzziipp and bbzziipp22.  Note that
           explicitly giving --kk overrides --UU.

       --crc32
           Use a crc32 checksum instead of a adler32 checksum.

       --no-warn
           Suppress all warnings.

       --ignore-warn
           Suppress all warnings, and never exit with exit status 2.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
           Suppress all warnings and decrease the verbosity of some commands
           like ----lliisstt or ----tteesstt.

       -v, --verbose
           Verbose. Display the name for each file compressed or decompressed.
           Multiple --vv can be used to increase the verbosity of some commands
           like ----lliisstt or ----tteesstt.

       --  Specifies that this is the end of the options. Any file name after
           ---- will not be interpreted as an option even if it starts with a
           hyphen.

OOTTHHEERR OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --no-stdin
           Do not try to read standard input (but a file name "-" will still
           override this option).  In old versions of llzzoopp, this option was
           necessary when used in cron jobs (which do not have a controlling
           terminal).

       --filter=_N_U_M_B_E_R
           Rarely useful.  Preprocess data with a special "multimedia" filter
           before compressing in order to improve compression ratio.  _N_U_M_B_E_R
           must be a decimal number from 1 to 16, inclusive.  Using a filter
           slows down both compression and decompression quite a bit, and the
           compression ratio usually doesn't improve much either...  More
           effective filters may be added in the future, though.

           You can try --filter=1 with data like 8-bit sound samples, --fil-
           ter=2 with 16-bit samples or depth-16 images, etc.

           Un-filtering during decompression is handled automatically.

       -C, --checksum
           Deprecated. Only for compatibility with very old versions as lzop
           now uses a checksum by default. This option will get removed in a
           future release.

       --no-color
           Do not use any color escape sequences.

       --mono
           Assume a mono ANSI terminal. This is the default under UNIX (if
           console support is compiled in).

       --color
           Assume a color ANSI terminal or try full-screen access. This is the
           default under DOS and in a Linux virtual console (if console sup-
           port is compiled in).

          tar --use-compress-program=lzop -cf archive.tar.lzo files..

       If you wish to create a single archive file with multiple members so
       that members can later be extracted independently, you should prefer a
       full-featured archiver such as tar. The latest version of GNU tar sup-
       ports the ----uussee--ccoommpprreessss--pprrooggrraamm==llzzoopp option to invoke lzop transpar-
       ently.  lzop is designed as a complement to tar, not as a replacement.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       The environment variable LLZZOOPP can hold a set of default options for
       lzop. These options are interpreted first and can be overwritten by
       explicit command line parameters.  For example:

           for sh/ksh/zsh:    LZOP="-1v --name"; export LZOP
           for csh/tcsh:      setenv LZOP "-1v --name"
           for DOS:           set LZOP=-1v --name

       On Vax/VMS, the name of the environment variable is LZOP_OPT, to avoid
       a conflict with the symbol set for invocation of the program.

       Not all of the options are valid in the environment variable - lzop
       will tell you.
