==================================================================
User visible changes for lzop -- a very fast file compressor
==================================================================

Changes in 1.01 (27 Apr 2003)
  * Five years have passed since the last release: completely updated
    the Autoconf build system, enable Autoconf large file support.
  * Warn about a compressed file's trailing zero bytes only if in
    verbose mode (for compatibility with recent versions of GNU tar).

    be necessary any longer.
  * Added option `-P' to save/restore the path name of a compressed file.

  * Fixed an assertion that could happen in very rare cases.
