Description: multicast file transfer tool
 a file transfer tool that can send data simultaneously to many destinations
 on a LAN. This can for instance be used to install entire classrooms of PC's
 at once. The advantage of UDPcast over using other methods (nfs, ftp, whatever)
 is that UDPcast uses Ethernet's multicast abilities: it won't take longer to
 install 15 machines than it would to install just 2.
