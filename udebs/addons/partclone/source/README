Partclone is a project similar to the well-known backup utility "Partition Image" a.k.a partimage. Partclone provides utilities to back up and restore used-blocks of a partition and it is designed for higher compatibility of the file system by using existing library, e.g. e2fslibs is used to read and write the ext2 partition.

Partclone supports ext2, ext3, hfs+, reiser3.5, reiser3.6, reiser4 and ext4 now. We plan to develop zfs and jfs file system. We made some utilies:

* partclone.ext2, partclone.ext3, partclone.extfs
* partclone.ext4
* partclone.reiserfs
* partclone.reiser4
* partclone.xfs
* partclone.fat
* partclone.hfsp
* partclone.info 
...

Some programs were included here to make clone better:
*  ntfsreloc: A GPL program for adjusting FS geometry on NTFS partitions
   Ref: http://www.linux-ntfs.org/doku.php?id=contrib:ntfsreloc
   It's renamed as partclone.ntfsreloc in partclone.
