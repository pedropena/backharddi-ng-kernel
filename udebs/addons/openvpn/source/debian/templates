Template: openvpn/change_init
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Would you like to start openvpn sooner?
 Previous versions of openvpn started at the same time as most of other
 services. This means that most of these services couldn't use openvpn
 since it may have been unavailable when they started. Newer versions of the
 openvpn package will start earlier. (i.e. a S16openvpn link in rc[235].d
 instead of a S20openvpn)
 .
 If you accept here, the package upgrade will make this change for you.
 If you refuse, nothing will change, and openvpn will be working just like
 it did before.

Template: openvpn/create_tun
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Would you like a TUN/TAP device to be created?
 If you accept here, the package will make a special device called
 /dev/net/tun for openvpn's use. If you refuse, the device won't be made
 now. Read README.Debian for details on how to make it. If you are using
 devfs refuse here.

Template: openvpn/stop2upgrade
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Would you like to stop openvpn before it gets upgraded?
 In some cases you may be upgrading openvpn in a remote server using
 a VPN to do so. The upgrade process stops the running daemon before 
 installing the new version, in that case you may lose your connection,
 the upgrade may be interrupted, and you may not be able to reconnect to
 the remote host.
 .
 Unless you do your upgrades locally, it is advised NOT to stop openvpn
 before it gets upgraded. The installation process will restart it once
 it's done.
 .
 This option will take effect in your next upgrade.

Template: openvpn/default_port
Type: note
_Description: Default port has changed
 OpenVPN's default port has changed from 5000 to 1194 (IANA assigned).
 If you don't specify the port to be used on your VPNs, this upgrade
 may break them. 
 .
 Use the option 'port 5000' if you want to keep the old port
 configuration, or take a look at your firewall rules to
 allow the new default port configuration to work.

Template: openvpn/change_init2
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Would you like to stop openvpn later?
 Previous versions of openvpn stopped at the same time as most of other
 services. This meant that some of services stopping later couldn't use 
 openvpn since it may have been stopped before them. Newer versions of the
 openvpn package will stop the service later. (i.e. a K80openvpn link in 
 rc[06].d instead of a K20openvpn)
 .
 If you accept here, the package upgrade will make this change for you.
 If you refuse, nothing will change, and openvpn will be working just like
 it did before.
