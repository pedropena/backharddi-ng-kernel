Notes for running partimage on other platforms than i386
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Officially partimage doesn't support other architectures than i386. Please
see http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=15091&group_id=6212
Section 2.5 for more details.
You may be lucky and partimage works on your platform. You should test this 
with unimportant data first. You should also try to avoid to create image 
files on one architecture and restore it on another.
