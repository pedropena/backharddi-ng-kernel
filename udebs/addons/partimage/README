Partition Image is a partition imaging utility which has support for the following file systems:
  * Ext2/3, the linux standard
  * Reiser3, a journalised and powerful file system
  * FAT16/32, DOS and Windows file systems
  * HPFS, IBM OS/2 File System
  * JFS, journalised File System, from IBM, used on AIX
  * XFS, another journalised and efficient File System, from sgi, used on Irix
  * UFS (beta), Unix File System
  * HFS (beta), MacOS File System
  * NTFS (experimental), Windows NT, 2000 and XP
Only used blocks are copied to save the space and to increase the speed.
The image file can be compressed, in gzip, or bzip2 formats, and can be splitted into
small files to be copied on floppies (1,44 MB, ZIP, ...).
Then, the partition can be restored if there is a problem on the partition (file system error,
virus, error in data, ...), from the image file. It can also be used to install many identical PCs with
the same hardware. You just have to install an only PC, and you can copy the linux
partitions to all others. 

Be carreful, this is an alpha version. Then, there can be bugs, and changes in the
data format between differents versions. Don't backup important data with it, and
use the same version to save and to restore the same image file. Please, report
all bugs to the author.

To compile it, run these commands in a terminal:
./configure && make && make install
type "rm config.cache" before if you have problems

Welcome to everybody who want to help the Partition Image project. There are many
ways to do it: writing translations in english or the text used inside the source code,
writing C++ code with new features, writing documentation (in SGML format),
Please e-mail the author to do it.
