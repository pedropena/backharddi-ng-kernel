Partimaged is still in alpha version. Use at your risks on production station or
server.

Partimaged was developped to provide Partition Image accros network.

For now, it can only handle up to ten remote connection and is very slow. 
It can be a serious hole in your network if not used behind a firewall since
it can access ANY file with root rigths.

To use, your just need to run it. By default, it listens on port 4025.

To use SSL, you need a certificate file and a private key file for this
certificate.

You can use your own files or generate them with `make certificates' after
compiling and installing partimage/partimaged:
use the following instructions:
./configure ..what you want.. --with-ssl
make
make install
make certificates.

The certificate files, must be installed in the directory containing partimaged.They are named partimaged.cert for the certificate and partimaged.key for the
private key of the certificate.

You have to edit partimagedusers to add all users you want to be able to
connect partimaged. Refer to FAQ or man partimagedusers to understand its
format.
