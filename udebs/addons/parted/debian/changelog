    happened. As i am going to also need to take more upstream
    responsabilities, i definitively want to recall for help on parted

    - udev-devfs-rules.dpatch: Check for devfs-style /disc => /partN
      transformation unconditionally; the system might be using udev with
      devfs rules, and if not the test is harmless.

    - PedUnit: support for different units for sizes and offsets.
    - Error message/UI cleanup.
    - More CHS cleanup.
    - Check /sys before trying deprecated SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND.
    - Better Apple_Free partition support.
    - Allow resizing of extended partitions, even if some logical partitions
      are mounted
    - Various DVH changes.
    - mac RAID and LVM support.
  * New upstream release (1.6.22)
    - hfs and hfs+ shrinking support merged in upstream.
    - gcc4 fixes.
    - minor UI and documentation changes/fixes.
    - support lvm on mac partition tables.
  * Backed out again the size column addition, was a patch from Jari Aalto
    <jari.aalto@cante.net> with regard to Bug #109613, but a new patch will
    hopefully make it to 1.6.24.
  * Unbashized dpatches (Closes: #298017)
  * Fixed amiga partition tables to use RAID/LVM partition types instead of
    subverting flags for it.
  * Removed the s390 patch, which needs a full review with regard to the
    PedUnit stuff i believe. In particular with regard to the sector size
    support. Please try to get this one integrated upstream, as it is the last 
    problematic big debian-specific patch remaining.

    - Sets the type to PED_DEVICE_UNKNOWN on block devices that don't fall
      into the standard categories.  This makes libparted correctly update
      the kernel's view of partition tables, etc.
  * Added comments about upstream status to all .dpatches.
  * Dropped parted-bf, we no longer build this package in the sarge/sid version.
  * Changed libparted1.6-udeb to provide libparted1.6-12. (Bug: #292781)

    - Fixed sun cylinder recording stuff, obsoleting sun_disklabel dpatch.
    - Removed bogus assertion, obsoleting no-clobber dpatch.
    - Only treat the device as devfs if it has /disc on the end.
    - Now use _partition_is_mounted_by_dev instead of guessing the partition
      device name.
    - Sets the type to PED_DEVICE_UNKNOWN on block devices that don't fall
      into the standard categories.  This makes libparted correctly update
      the kernel's view of partition tables, etc.  
    - Improved heuristic for finding broken dos partition tables: test if
      any feasible solution geometry exists against the end cylinder rather
      than 1024. This heuristic now has fewer false negatives and no false
      positives.

  * Made libparted's reiserfs support dlopen the full filename of libreiserfs,
    rather than just the libreiserfs.so symlink. This means that parted's
    reiserfs support will now work without the libreiserfs0.3-dev package

  * This upstream release supports creating/resizing reiserfs filesystems,
    if Yury Umanets' libreiserfs is installed. However, there is no Debian
    package of libreiserfs (yet - I am working on it). So if you want this
    support, you'll have to fetch progsreiserfs from
    http://reiserfs.linux.kiev.ua/ and compile/install it yourself for this
    support to be activated.

    (closes: #137104)
  * debian/control.in: make all parted1.6 packages Priority: extra, as
    parted1.6 and parted1.6-doc Conflict: with the optional parted and
    parted-doc packages.
  * removed "#include <asm/page.h>" from libparted/fs_linux_swap/linux_swap.c,
    which should fix build problems on ia64.

parted1.6 (1.5+1.6.0-pre4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream pre-release
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: ship locales package separately. This
    means that libparted1.6-0 no longer needs to Conflict: libparted1.4,
    both packages can be installed concurrently. Actually, I just realised
    that libparted1.6-0 never actually needed to Conflict: libparted1.4,
    Replaces: libparted1.4 would have been enough ...
  * debian/control.in:
    - Added pre-release status of package to package descriptions
      (closes: #137475)
    - Made libparted1.6-0 Replaces: libparted1.4 (<< 1.4.24-2).
      libparted1.4 (>= 1.4.24-2) should be able to co-exist with libparted1.6,
      but I forgot about the (<< 1.4.24-2) case ... (closes: #137567)
  * debian/rules:
    - debian/rules: use DESTDIR rather than prefix when 'make install'ing.
      Use $(CURDIR) instead of `pwd`.
    - lots of small fixes
    - remove the locales dir from debian/tmp before checking if any files
      are left after dh_movefiles
  * debian/parted.files: Grab all of sbin rather than just sbin/parted.
    This picks up partprobe
  * debian/parted.undocumented: partprobe currently has no manpage (will be
    fixed before 1.6.0-1 goes into sid)

  * New upstream release
  * Upstream now uses C99's PRIx64 for printf'ing __u64's - this fixes
    compilation warnings on alpha and ia64 (closes: #115369)
  * This should fix all alpha compile warnings, so removed --disable-Werror

parted (1.4.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Lots of updates to get stuff building properly, merged
    binary-common and binary-libparted$(LIBPKGVER)-dbg rules.
  * debian/control updates:
    - added Build-Depends: autoconf (>= 2.50), automake (>= 1.4-p1), libtool
      (closes: Bug#98673)

parted (1.4.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/rules: made {build{,-dbg},configure{,-dbg}}-stamp stuff depend
    directly on $(GENFILES), which stops ./configure from being repeatedly
    run unnecessarily during the build procedure.

parted (1.4.11-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: libparted1.4-dbg Priority: extra
  * debian/control: parted & libparted-dev now Suggests: parted-doc
    (closes: Bug#97556)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Tue, 15 May 2001 23:13:41 +1000

parted (1.4.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some big updates - lots of library versioning stuff automated ...
    - debian/control and debian/shlibs.local now being generated from
      debian/control.in and debian/shlibs.local.in respectively, with
      debian/rules
    - debian/libparted2{,-dev}.* moved to debian/libparted{,-dev}.*,
      these are now copied to their appropriate places when necessary
    - LIBPKGVER variable added to debian/rules, this is the library
      package version (part of the library name). Initially set to
      1.4, which is the new version number of libparted (ie. the
      libparted package is now named libparted1.4, to keep in line
      with upstream). I'll add a letter which will be bumped whenever
      upstream's soname changes, if necessary (ie. libparted1.4a) ...
  * Added support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt (compiles without -O2).
  * debian/control.in debian/rules: Added building of libparted2-dbg
    package, unstripped static lib with malloc debugging enabled.
  * Fixed problem with ./configure being run twice, once on
    'debian/rules build' and again on 'debian/rules binary-arch'
  * Fixed shlibs library version _properly_, I changed the depends:
    version but not the soname version :-(. With the versioning automation
    stuff I have also added a LIBSONAME substitution, and also check that
    parted's soname is what debian/rules (and thus debian/shlibs.local)
    think that it is ...

parted (1.4.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apparently 1.4.11 has a new soname, changed shlibs.local and
    dh_makeshlibs to use (>= 1.4.11) (closes: Bug#95846)

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control, debian/libparted1[-dev]*, debian/rules:

parted (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

  * Changed shlibs to depend on 'libparted1 (>= 1.4.0)' rather than
    'libparted1 (= ${Source-Version})'.
  * Made libparted1 Conflicts: libparted0 Replaces: libparted0 (since both
    have their NLS messages in /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/parted.mo) -
    I must find some way to work around this!!!

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Nov 2000 09:49:54 +1100

parted (1.2.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Changed build system to use DH_COMPAT=2, so the 'parted' package now
    builds in the debian/parted directory. This included moving the 'dirs'
    file to 'parted.dirs', and 'docs' to 'parted.docs', amongst other things.

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Nov 2000 14:59:25 +1100

parted (1.2.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Moved parted.m4 (in /usr/share/aclocal) from parted to libparted0-dev.
  * Moved all locales (from /usr/share/locales) from parted to libparted0.
    This is the right behavior since most of the messages are for libparted,
    I have asked the author if it is possible to split parted and libparted
    locales ...
  * Made libparted0 and libparted0-dev Conflict: parted (<< 1.2.11) to
    avoid dpkg needing --force-overwrite ...
  * Added -D_REENTRANT to CFLAGS in libparted/Makefile.am - to conform
    to policy 3.2.1.
  * Policy 3.2.1

parted (1.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Shared libs in libparted0 now install to /lib (otherwise it's pointless
    having the parted executable in /sbin ...)
  * Now building shlibs with `libparted 0 libparted0 (= ${Source-Version})'
    rather than >= ... This is because the libparted API is still changing
    quite regularly.

    (the word 'disk' was missing)

 -- Timshel Knoll <timshel@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jun 2000 13:25:56 +1000

parted (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release

    or libparted0-dev already installed, fixed in this version.
  * Maintainer email addresses updated to `timshel@debian.org'
  * debian/README.Debian updated to remove stuff about why shared libs
    won't build (because they can be now) :)

    contains the shared libraries.
  * Renamed libparted-dev to libparted0-dev. This still Provides: libparted-dev

    'parted' binary packages from 'utils' to 'admin' (admin is more suitable)
  * "Architecture: any" for both packages, (was 'i386 alpha'), so
    packages will now be built for other arches (for resizing old DOS
    drives, as parted currently only support DOS partition tables)
