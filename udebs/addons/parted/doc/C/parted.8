.TH PARTED 8 "2007 March 29" parted "GNU Parted Manual"
.SH NAME
GNU Parted \- a partition manipulation program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B parted
[options] [device [command [options...]...]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B parted
is a disk partitioning and partition resizing program.  It allows you to
create, destroy, resize, move and copy ext2, linux-swap, FAT, FAT32, and reiserfs
partitions.  It can create, resize, and move Macintosh HFS partitions, as well as detect jfs,
ntfs, ufs, and xfs partitions.  It is useful for creating space for new operating systems,
reorganising disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks.
.PP
This manual page documents \fBparted\fP briefly.  Complete documentation is
distributed with the package in GNU Info format; see near the bottom.

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B [device]
The block device to be used.  When none is given, \fBparted\fP will use the
first block device it finds.
.TP
.B [command [options]]
Specifies the command to be executed.  If no command is given,
.BR parted
will present a command prompt.  Possible commands are:
.RS
.TP
.B check \fIpartition\fP
Do a simple check on \fIpartition\fP.
.TP
.B cp \fI[source-device]\fP \fIsource\fP \fIdest\fP
Copy the \fIsource\fP partition's filesystem on \fIsource-device\fP (or the
current device if no other device was specified) to the \fIdest\fP partition
on the current device.
.TP
.B help \fI[command]\fP
Print general help, or help on \fIcommand\fP if specified.
.TP
.B mkfs \fIpartition\fP \fIfs-type\fP
Make a filesystem \fIfs-type\fP on \fIpartition\fP. \fIfs-type\fP can be one
of "fat16", "fat32", "ext2", "linux-swap", or "reiserfs".
.TP
.B mklabel \fIlabel-type\fP
Create a new disklabel (partition table) of \fIlabel-type\fP.
\fIlabel-type\fP should be one of "bsd", "dvh", "gpt", "loop", "mac", "msdos",
"pc98", or "sun".
.TP
.B mkpart \fIpart-type\fP \fI[fs-type]\fP \fIstart\fP \fIend\fP
Make a \fIpart-type\fP partition with filesystem \fIfs-type\fP (if specified),
beginning at \fIstart\fP and ending at \fIend\fP (by default in megabytes).
\fIfs-type\fP can be one of
"fat16", "fat32", "ext2", "HFS", "linux-swap", "NTFS", "reiserfs", or "ufs".
\fIpart-type\fP should be one of "primary", "logical", or "extended".
.TP
.B mkpartfs \fIpart-type\fP \fIfs-type\fP \fIstart\fP \fIend\fP
Make a \fIpart-type\fP partition with filesystem \fIfs-type\fP beginning at
\fIstart\fP and ending at \fIend\fP (by default in megabytes).  Using
this command is discouraged.  Instead use
.BR mkpart
to create an empty partition, and then use external tools like
.BR mke2fs (8)
to create the filesystem.
.TP
.B move \fIpartition\fP \fIstart\fP \fIend\fP
Move \fIpartition\fP so that it begins at \fIstart\fP and ends at \fIend\fP.
Note: \fBmove\fP never changes the minor number.
.TP
.B name \fIpartition\fP \fIname\fP
Set the name of \fIpartition\fP to \fIname\fP. This option works only on Mac,
PC98, and GPT disklabels. The name can be placed in quotes, if necessary.
.TP
.B print
Display the partition table.
.TP
.B quit
Exit from \fBparted\fP.
.TP
.B rescue \fIstart\fP \fIend\fP
Rescue a lost partition that was located somewhere between \fIstart\fP and
\fIend\fP.  If a partition is found, \fBparted\fP will ask if you want to
create an entry for it in the partition table.
.TP
.B resize \fIpartition\fP \fIstart\fP \fIend\fP
Resize the filesystem on \fIpartition\fP so that it begins at \fIstart\fP and
ends at \fIend\fP (by default in megabytes).
.TP
.B rm \fIpartition\fP
Delete \fIpartition\fP.
.TP
.B select \fIdevice\fP
Choose \fIdevice\fP as the current device to edit. \fIdevice\fP should usually
be a Linux hard disk device, but it can be a partition, software raid device,
or an LVM logical volume if necessary.
.TP
.B set \fIpartition\fP \fIflag\fP \fIstate\fP
Change the state of the \fIflag\fP on \fIpartition\fP to \fIstate\fP.
Supported flags are: "boot", "root", "swap", "hidden", "raid", "lvm", "lba",
and "palo".
\fIstate\fP should be either "on" or "off".
.TP
.B unit \fIunit\fP
Set \fIunit\fP as the unit to use when displaying locations and sizes,
and for interpreting those given by the user when not suffixed with an
explicit unit.  \fIunit\fP can be one of "s" (sectors), "B" (bytes), "kB",
"MB", "GB", "TB", "%" (percentage of device size), "cyl" (cylinders),
"chs" (cylinders, heads, sectors), or "compact" (megabytes for input,
and a human-friendly form for output).
.TP
.B version
Display version information and a copyright message.
.RE
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
ext3 filesystem functionality does not currently work.  To manage ext3
type filesystems use tools like
.BR resize2fs (8)
or
.BR mke2fs (8).
Note that the currently supported ext2 filesystem will be deprecated
once ext3 support is finalized.  Further note that ext3 support will
have limited functionality that is yet to be defined.  Use tools like
.BR resize2fs (8)
and
.BR mke2fs (8)
to manage these types of filesystems.

To manually resize an ext3 filesystem and/or a partition use
.BR resize2fs (8),
.BR fdisk (8)
or similar tools.  For LVM situations, you will need to use the LVM commands
to resize the LVM elements.
