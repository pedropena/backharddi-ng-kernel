This is rfbplaymacro, a remote control utility for VNC.

An example macro file "test.rfm" exists.
To use it, you should

  chown yourname test.rfm
  chmod 600 test.rfm

it, so no one else can read it.

Now you can safely insert your VNC password after "password" in the file.

Run a VNC Client on your desktop, so you can watch what the script will do.

Run (on the local machine, of course)

  rfbplaymacro --server=myhost:1 < test.rfm

The macro simply opens an xclock and kills it after 10 seconds using xkill.

The script implies that your VNC server has been started with the
-alwaysshared option, and that your VNC desktop starts with an xterm in the
upper left corner of your screen.
