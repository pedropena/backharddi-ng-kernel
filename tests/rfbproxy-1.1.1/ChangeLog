2001-02-28  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

2000-08-03  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.1: New file.

	* rfbproxy.c (DEFAULT_CYCLE): Remove.

2000-07-28  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (main): --playback and --record no longer require an
	argument (since the multiple file change).

2000-07-25  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (VERSION): Version 0.5.1 (devel).

2000-07-25  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (do_read): s/write/read/.
	(handle_keys_during_playback): New function.  Code mostly copied
	from record: someone should merge those somehow.
	(playback): New parameters cycle and pause.  Handle cycling and
	pausing.  Cycling currently uses a nasty heuristic to decide when
	it's safe to stop.  It would be nicer if it could be made to
	understand what it's sending, but maybe that would be too
	complicated.  The same goes for authentication.  Cycling will most
	likely only work with FBS files recorded from rfbproxy.
	(main): Handle --pause and --cycle.

2000-07-21  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (main): --loop doesn't take an argument.
	(usage): Remove duplicate 'file' in usage text.
	(main): Allow lists of files for playback.  Add stubs for --pause
	and --cycle.
	(DEFAULT_CYCLE): Define.
	(playback): Return -1 for failure, >0 for success (and loop is
	okay). (0 implies looping is not okay.)  Loop parameter now means
	'need to call rewind_file first'.
	(usage): Update.
	(VERSION): Version 0.5.0 (devel).

2000-07-06  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (VERSION): Version 0.4.0 (stable).

2000-06-21  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	(VERSION): Version 0.3.2 (devel).

2000-06-20  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (record): Open file for writing in binary mode (for
	systems where that makes any sense).

2000-06-16  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (usage): Say what the default display is.
	(VERSION): Version 0.3.1 (devel).

2000-06-14  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* TODO: Cross off 'macro recording'. :-)

	* rfbproxy.c (process_client_message): Now we actually process the
	client's messages, if --type==events.  Output is in RFM format.
	* rfbproxy.c: Update comments.

2000-06-13  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (VERSION): Version 0.3.0 (devel).
	(do_authentication): New function.

	modified.

	* rfbproxy.c (record): FBS file format correction: version number
	at beginning.
	(playback): Likewise.
	(record): Check for errors when closing the output file.
	(VERSION): Version 0.12.  Hopefully the output file format is
	stable this time!

2000-06-09  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (record): Use fbs file format.
	(playback): Use fbs file format.
	(VERSION): Version 0.11.

2000-06-09  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (read_traffic): Fix buffering problems.
	(VERSION): Version 0.10.

2000-06-08  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (playback): Use select portably.
	(rewind_file): Handle bad input.

2000-06-06  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (playback): Fix thinkos: open returns -1 on failure,
	and mmap returns MAP_FAILED.

2000-06-03  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (usage): Make static.
	(BUFSIZE): Make larger.
	(main): Rewritten entirely: use getopt, look nicer.  Add
	stdin/stdout functionality.  Move socket stuff here.
	(playback): Remove socket stuff.  Loop over write.  Make static.
	(record): Remove socket stuff.  Loop over write.  Make static.
	(accept_connection): New function.
	(playback): Delay threshold of 5ms: delays shorter than that are
	ignored.  This gives a substantial improvement in speed.
	(record): Use newer file format.
	(playback): Likewise.
	(playback): Better error checking.
	(do_write): New function.
	(read_traffic): New function (for --loop).
	(rewind_file): New function (for --loop).
	(playback): Looping.

2000-05-31  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (playback): Use a much larger buffer size here too.
	(record): Use FD_SETSIZE as select's nfds.
	(playback): Likewise.
	(playback): Handle client closing connection.

2000-05-30  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* rfbproxy.c (record): Use a much larger buffer size.  Suggested
	by Roberto Diaz <rdiazmar@dit.upm.es>.
