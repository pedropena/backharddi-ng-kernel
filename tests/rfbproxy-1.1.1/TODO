"full" translation during playback would involve keeping a copy of the
framebuffer and feeding the client exactly what it asks for, instead
of mindlessly copying packets.  I actually don't think it'd be that
hard, since we could just rip the code out of the VNC X server that
transmits a framebuffer.
