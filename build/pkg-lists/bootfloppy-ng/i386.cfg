# These udebs (and NOT base) are used to build a special boot floppy that
# boots up and loads a second floppy.
# Note that due to space reasons, cdebconf is not on this floppy image.

# The floppy needs to prompt for enter to be hit, even with a USB keyboard.
# But, usb keyboard support won't fit, so exclude it..

# USB stuff commented out due to terminal lack of space.

# Include support for USB floppy drives, and other storage media.

#scsi-core-modules-${kernel:Version}
# This is here for just one symbol that the usb-storage module needs.
# In theory, that symbol could be moved out to its own kernel module,
# but we have not been tight enough on space yet to need to do that.
# (Update: Now we have run out of space, but we've still not managed to
# do it...)
