The two files listed below were only added in this release to allow building
the installer using updated kernel udebs for Etch point releases.
- sources.list.udeb.local
- sources.list.udeb.local.README

If you want to build the installer yourself, you will probably want to delete
these files. The function of sources.list.udeb.local is explained in the
README file in this directory.
